# Custom_quad_copter
Built a quadcopter from scratch with a custom flight controller, PCB, and 3D printed frame.
# PARTS LIST
*Note, a lot of these parts were bought in bulk because I didn't have them. You probably have some of these parts lying around
- **FrSky D8R-II Plus**: Old receiver, found it on Facebook Marketplace
- **JRXP303 Radio Controller**: Old controller, found it on Facebook Marketplace

- **Resistor Kit**: For resisting things, of course, lots of use on the drone 
- **Led Kit**: Indicators for drone startup
- **Bread Board**: For prototyping
- **XT30 Plug to JST  Connector**: For battery to PCB connection
- **2300KV Brushless Motor CCW CW**: To move the drone around
- **Teensy 4.0**: Microcontroller, brain of the drone
- **Gyroscope/Accelerometer**: MPU-6050, so I can see how the drone is moving
- **Barometer**: To measure the height of the drone
- **Electronic Speed Controllers**: To move the motors at a variable throttle
- **5" Props** To create upward thrust for movement
- **3S Battery** To power the drone!
- **LiPO Battery Charger**: So we can fly the drone more than once
