# PARTS LIST
*Note, a lot of these parts were bought in bulk because I didn't have them. You probably have some of these parts lying around
- **FrSky D8R-II Plus**: Old receiver, found it on Facebook Marketplace
- **JRXP303 Radio Controller**: Old controller, found it on Facebook Marketplace
- **FrSky DJT RF Transmitter**: Old transmitter, connects with the JRXP303 controller and sends the RF PWM signal, flashed with updated firmware to run in PWM 
- **Resistor Kit**: For resisting things, of course, lots of use on the drone 
- **Led Kit**: Indicators for drone startup
- **Bread Board**: For prototyping
- **XT30 Plug to JST  Connector**: For battery to PCB connection
- **2300KV Brushless Motor CCW CW**: To move the drone around
- **Teensy 4.0**: Microcontroller, brain of the drone
- **Gyroscope/Accelerometer**: MPU-6050, so I can see how the drone is moving
- **Barometer**: To measure the height of the drone
- **Electronic Speed Controllers**: To move the motors at a variable throttle
- **5" Props** To create upward thrust for movement
- **3S Battery** To power the drone!
- **LiPO Battery Charger**: So we can fly the drone more than once
- **Custom PCB**: See repository files for the CAD
- **GPS and RF receiver/transmitter**: For return to home functionality and transmitting onboard tellmetry
  
# COMPLETED STEPS
*Note, this project is incredibly complex and will have individual nuances based on the parts you buy and how low-level you go. For example, I wanted to try and create my flight controller from scratch because I wanted to understand how all these electrical and physical systems interact with one another to make my drone fly, rather then just build the drone. 

# NEXT STEPS
- I'm currently working on implementing the GPS and Return to Home functionality. I took a small break on the project to pursue a couple of other ideas, such as my Pok√©mon card detector project and my video game idea.
